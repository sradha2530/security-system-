RapidEye

RapidEye is a smart surveillance system that uses solar power to operate anywhere, even without electricity. It has a camera with night vision and GPS to monitor its surroundings 24/7. The system uses artificial intelligence to analyse video detecting crimes like theft, violence, or gunshots as they happen. When a threat is detected, it immediately sends alerts to police with live video, location, and suspect photos. It can recognize faces and read license plates, matching them against police databases to identify criminals or stolen vehicles. All data is securely stored and sent through mobile networks or satellite. This technology combines power independence, smart detection, and fast communication to keep communities safe. RapidEye can also be installed in homes for a more personalized surveillance.
